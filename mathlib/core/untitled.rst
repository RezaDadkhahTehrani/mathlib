Chapter 1 - Numbers
===================
Mathematics has come a long a way and we have started to think about new
sets of numbers and things we can do on them - this book will attempt to 
describe them. In this chapter, we'll describe notation for classical sets
of numbers and introduce the idea of an equivalence relation.
