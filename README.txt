MathLib
========

MathLib is a python library that provides a variety packages and
modules containing functions and methods useful for many different
mathematical fields including linear algebra, statistics, and topics
in number theory.

The purpose of this package is for educational purposes/ self-learning
and does not seek to replace veteran, open-source libraries as NumPy 
or SciPy.

linalg
=======

This package contains various functions useful for different topics
in linear algebra including eigenvector analysis, decompositions, and
matrix manipulation among other things.

stats
======

This package contains various functions useful for different topics
in statistics including descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and
probability distributions.


numbers
=======

This package contains various functions useful for different topics in 
pure number theory including prime number analysis, set manipulation, and
cryptographic/hash function implementations of these ideas.

optimization
============

This package contains various functions useful for different topics
in optimization including linear/non-linear optimization, the simplex
method, as well as methods for solving various graph based problems
including minimum spanning trees and network flow.
