MathLib

Introduction
------------
MathLib is a python library that provides a variety packages and
modules containing functions and methods useful for many different
mathematical fields including linear algebra, statistics, optimization,
cryptography, and computer science.

The purpose of this package is for educational purposes/ self-learning
and does not seek to replace veteran, open-source libraries as NumPy 
or SciPy.

Features
--------
I wanted to build a complete mathematics library from scratch so there
aren't any depedencies - even core python libraries. So I guess it's
more for my curiosity than for any practical, third party uses.

Goals
-----
Decide whether to put mathematical abstractions into the core folder or
into separate folders, i.e., should I move matrix.py into the Linear
Algebra folder or keep it in the core folder.
